##  Logs

- Started Documenting logs for significant progress and updates
- Ideas for project: 
    SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) - Evaluate aspects of water using computer vision and CNN's to classify a picture of water as 'drinkable' or not.
    SDG 14 (Life Under Water) - Use CNN's to detect plastic trash/objects in the water.
- Current Problems:
    Downloading certain packages like tensorflow do not work. Tensorflow installed on computer. Needs further troubleshooting
- Found multiple datasets containing photos of trash underwater. However, I can't upload files larger than 25MB onto github. I will most likely post the hyperlink to where I got the dataset instead. Additionally, the majority of these datasets also have extraneous files such as .txt and .xml files that I don't need. A lot of photos look almost identical to each other too, so I will have to do some preprocessing.

- Fixed Tensorflow issue
- Made commit comments clearer (lol)
- Started creating a model. I started the project on kaggle for now because I am still having some issues with downloading packages on my macbook. Will transfer onto github soon
